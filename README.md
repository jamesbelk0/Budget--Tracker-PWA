## Description
1. Using an express server, create a localhost note taker that can create, save and delete notes. Using the 'Save' class from OOP to keep it more simpified (at least to me). 
2. Api/HTML routes are split for ease of access if needing to change anything. 

## Usage
- Start the 'Inquirer' prompt via "node server.js"
- Go through prompts to find, update, add or remove any data!
